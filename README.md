# Enventory
An Electronics Warehouse Inventory System (WMS) for every electrical engineer.

The pure php approach (v1), along with porting to codeIgniter (v2) has been abandoned. I have decided to use laravel.
I will upload the new version when it is at least somewhat functional.
Please note that development is slowly done during the school year.

# Requirements
  1. Be able to handle various electrical componets that do not have a set number of attributes (Like transformers). Will use json.
  2. Be able to export (csv, excel, pdf) data
  3. Provide standard WMS functionality such as users w/ groups, auditing...
  4. Be completely free
